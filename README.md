# Hypercube Extruders
Direct drive and Bowden swappable extruders for the Hypercube design of printer

_insert header image here_

### Background
These extruders take a lot of their design inspiration from the (original hypercube
design by Tech2C)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766]. In particular the bowden
extruder is very similar and credit for that original design should go to Tech2C. The
Direct drive extruder is loosely modelled on the PrusaMk3 extruder but with a completely
redesigned idler design.

### Motivations
Both the Bowden and Direct extruders are designed to be swappable on the hypercube, and to
fit within the build volume of a stock designed hypecube without having to move any of the
other parts to make it functional. In particular, working out how to enclose the stepper
motor and blower fans for the Direct Drive extruder was the most tricky. The latter allows
the Hypercube design of printer to print flexible filaments like TPU.

Both extruders use the same print head mounting as Tech2C designed for the orignal hypercube
and are designed to fit to a normal hypercube X-carriage.

Neither of the extruders include an inductive Z probe. They are designed for an AnyCubic
Ultrabase bed (Glass), and so use a Z endstop rather than a probe. Anyone wishing to add a
Z probe mount to the designs, pull requests will be considered, or people are welcome to
duplicate and edit these designs on Thingiverse of fork this repository on Github. Please
link back to this repository or the designs on Github, I'd love to help people find the right
extruder for them.
